Developing
----------

Prepare a developer environment.  Then, from the telnetlib3 code folder::

    pip install --editable .

Any changes made in this project folder are then made available to the python
interpreter as the 'telnetlib3' module irregardless of the current working
directory.

Running Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install and run tox

::

    pip install --upgrade tox

    tox

Py.test is used as the test runner, supporting positional arguments, you may
for example use `looponfailing
<https://pytest.org/latest/xdist.html#running-tests-in-looponfailing-mode>`
with python 3.5, stopping at the first failing test case, and looping
(retrying) after a filesystem save is detected::

    tox -epy35 -- -fx


Style and Static Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All standards enforced by the underlying tools are adhered to by this project,
with the declarative exception of those found in `landscape.yml
<https://github.com/jquast/telnetlib3/blob/master/.landscape.yml>`_, or inline
using ``pylint: disable=`` directives.
